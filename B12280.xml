            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="3">3. A carefull education of youth in godly exerciſes according to the rules of wholeſome diſcipline; requiring paines in the Paſtour, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in the Schoole-maſter, and care in the Parents, to bring or ſee them brought up in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and feare of the Lord, daily ſolliciting the throne of grace for a bleſſing on all: the firſt hath not, nor ſhall, I truſt, be wanting in any duty publike or private; thus farre I am bold on my brothers behalfe, unknowne unto him: the ſecond, neither hath, nor is wanting; your owne Schoole having furniſht one age already with great Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, famous in their kinde; and now the preſent hopes,<note place="margin">Renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell:</hi> and <hi>Harding.</hi>

            <p>Education of children is one fundamentall prop, either to begin or uphold a ſocietie in well-being; a meanes to ſtay originall corruption from brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king forth, to make way for ſaving grace and to turne the hatred of our enemies into feare,<note place="margin">Prov. 22.6.

            <p>This were enough, without

            <pb facs="tcp:177910:5"/>
            <p>Firſt, a conditionall neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and that, firſt to manifeſt unto others, what obedience is due, and what reſpect hath beene given here, to thoſe So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne commands of ſuch, who with Princely providence and fatherly care, doe or lately did ſway the Scepter of this ſtate: under King <hi>Henry</hi> 8.<note place="margin">See the Acts and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Church.</note> it was ordained, that Curates in their Sermons ſhould delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately and plainly goe over the <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> Creed and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, one clauſe or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle one day, and another, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day; till the whole were taught and learned by little and little, and that they ſhould deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſame in writing. And after—that fathers and mothers, maſters and governors of youth ſhould teach or cauſe to bee taught their children and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, even from their infancy, the <hi>Pater-noſter,</hi> Creed and Commandements in their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:177910:6"/> tongue: and the ſame ſo taught ſhould cauſe the ſaid youth oft to repeat and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. Vnder <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt, I finde it enjoyned—That the Creed, Lords Prayer, and ten Commaundements ſhould bee read in Engliſh every Holy-day: that the people ſhould bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted not only to learne them themſelves, but alſo to teach them to their children and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; that once a yeere all their Pariſhioners ſhould be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therein, and that none ſhould preſume to come unto the Lords Table (let all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters take notice, to ſee this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which by the Law of God ought, and by the lawes of our Land may be, obſerved in every Pariſh) without a true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof: the ſame for ſubſtance during the Raigne of that renowned Queene <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> King <hi>Iames,</hi> and his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie that now is, renewed ſtill,
<pb facs="tcp:177910:6"/> continued and confirmed: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it is to obſerve, how the neglect of this dutie increaſeth daily; eſpecially there, where nothing, or as nothing, is done the later part of the Lords day; ſecondly, to render you your owne, as God commands, ſome teſtimony of thankfulneſſe, for your ready and continuing love (more worth then wealth) ſince my firſt comming amongſt you: what the good Shunamite did for <hi>Eliſha:</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.10. you have doubled to me every way; and behold now, you have been thus carefull for mee, with all this care, what is to be done for you? leſſe I could not, and more you expect not, dwelling contentedly among your owne people, then meanes to further your ſalvation; the Lord grant his Word may be in that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull and plaine evidence of the Spirit delivered, as that many
<pb facs="tcp:177910:7"/> ſonnes and daughters may bee borne unto Chriſt amongſt you. Thirdly, to ſave the weariſome labour of tranſcription; called upon we have beene lately and begun, to goe over the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; this benefit the Preſſe affoards; not only to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with eaſe, but alſo to prevent ſome inconveniences might happen both to you and mee, by reaſon of many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Copies abroad, which cannot be recalled, not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes over-maſtered, now if any thing be amiſſe, it may be amended, if any point ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, it may be explained, or if in any part deficient, a ſupply may bee added. Fourthly, to minde men and women of that ſolemne vow and promiſe made at the Font, in their behalfe, for whom they become ſureties, to teach or ſee they be taught, the uſe and end of Baptiſme, the Creed, Lords Prayer, and ten
<pb facs="tcp:177910:7"/> commandements in the Engliſh tongue, with all other things, which Chriſtians ought to know and doe for their ſoules health, and that they be vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly brought up, &amp;c. which many, I feare, undertake raſhly as a matter of forme and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, never thinking of it after. Fifthly, to point out a common calamity which I find rife in every place; many old people have no other religion, nor ground for ſalvation, but what conſiſts in a bare and (of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) ſenſeleſſe repetition of this Cathechiſme, not finding, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it a prayer, hoping only in the grace of regeneration by Baptiſme, never thinking of, nor endeauouring to performe the conditions, expreſt in the adminiſtration of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Sixthly, in deſire at leaſt to redeeme, many precious houres miſpent in wanton pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digalitie which (bleſſed be the
<pb facs="tcp:177910:8"/> Lord) I live to bewaile, and make ſome verball ſatisfaction, for reall wrongs, I remember, done to others, by enticement, ſilence, example, &amp;c. which to perſons remote and diſperſt cannot elſe be effected: as alſo to repay ſomthing to the poore and ignorant, in lieu of what I received from the richly-lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: a number of good helps I found and would not leſſen them; learning as lands, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed is forfeit, the talent hid is loſt; riches are counterfeit, if not currant, ſo as a portion may ſucceſſively fall to every mans ſhare; who knowes what good, weakeſt endeavours may doe to the Church unborne? whoſe papers ſhall longeſt eſcape the devouring teeth of time and tyrannie? or what diſmall cloud of Popiſh darkeneſſe (which the Lord prevent and keepe off) may in after times once againe overſpread this Britiſh Ile, to
<pb facs="tcp:177910:8"/> laſh our wantonneſſe and make our people, prize more the meanes of knowledge? when courſer fare will be more eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, then dainties now.</p>
            <p>Secondly, a purpoſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire I had (If the Lord ſhould remoove mee from you; a cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie body, and the daily depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of others, my deare friends and neighbours, minde mee often of mortalitie) to leave remaining with you, who have beene either called or confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by my miniſtry, the ſumme of all, which I have at ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times delivered; not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preſidents; Saint <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> having preacht to the Iewes, and being called to the Gentiles (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets <hi>Euſebius</hi>) deemed it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to leave (and that in his owne countrey language) ſome memoriall of his doctrine with them, from whom hee was to depart in body: <hi>Bellar. lib.</hi> 4.

               </p>
               <p>A. That Catechiſme is moſt fit and conuenient,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.1, 2. 1 Cor. 10.33.11.16.</note> to be explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the aſſembly, which is inioyned by publike authority, expreſt for vs in our booke

               <p>A.

               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:177910:19"/>

               <p>Q. <hi>What is done for vs in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Three things: firſt the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the name, a practice ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ancient and vſefull.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>To whom belongs it to giue the name?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Vnto the parents proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; by their permiſſion,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.19. Luke 2.21.</note> the ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or Miniſter may doe it, ſometime neighbours haue done it, <hi>Ruth.</hi> 4.17.</p>

               </p>
               <p>A. Firſt, for diſtinction ſake,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.20. 1 Sam. 4.21. Mat. 1.21, 23</note> that one might bee knowne from another, and euery one cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by his right name. Secondly, for ſignification, to put men in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:177910:20"/> minde of ſome good by their names. Thirdly, then giuen, that as often as we heare, reade or write our names,<note place="margin">Reu. 17.3.</note> we might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Couenant made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Lord and vs.</p>

               <p>A. Three things eſpecially: Firſt, preſumption, that none giue the Name of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of Chriſt, of the holy Ghoſt, or of ſome Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call graces; As Iehova, Adonai, Elohim, Ieſus, Emmanuel, Holy or Holineſſe; Faith, hope, loue, &amp;c. Secondly, affected and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſiue curioſitie, by making a ſingular compoſition of many words, which in another lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage might, in ours cannot well make a name; as feare God, doe well, &amp;c.

               <p>Q. <hi>What is the ſecond thing done in Baptiſme?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. The bringing and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing children into a particular viſible Church,<note place="margin">Mar. 10.14.</note> &amp; admitting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the vſe of Chriſts ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and priuiledges of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the third thing?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. The ſignifying, exhibiting, and ſealing to the party bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.21.</note> his or her ingrafting into Chriſt, remiſſion of ſinnes, and imputation of Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes vpon a conditionall Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is that Couenant?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. That God will bee our God for euer,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.18. Eze. 36.25, 26.</note> forgiue vs our ſinnes and ſaue vs, if we will be his people, cleaue vnto him with purpoſe of heart, loue and ſerue him aboue all other.</p>

               </p>
               <p>A. No, God therfore in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme ſeales alſo vnto vs, the promiſe of his grace, thereby to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:177910:21"/> enable vs.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is that grace?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Not any one; but the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſeed and root of all graces: our right vnto all,<note place="margin">Acts 2.38.22.16.</note> is ſealed in baptiſme, although the actuall poſſeſſion and manifeſtation come long after ſometimes, by the vſe of ſome other ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Is this Sacrament abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to ſaluation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. No: God may conuey grace without it,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.29 Rom. 2.28. Iohn 3.5.</note> who hath not tyed his grace to it; none may ſleight it, it is neceſſary in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Chriſts inſtitution as an ordinary outward meanes of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation; nor condemne ſuch who depart this life, neither recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing nor contemning the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <p>Q. <hi>But is not that a raſh and dangerous promiſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. No: if rightly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; for firſt it is but a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall promiſe, if the Lord giue his promiſed grace. Secondly, it is but a charitable expreſſion of Chriſtian hope, grounded

               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is this duty ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in the people, to ſay A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men vnto the Miniſters Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er?</hi>

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it doth wonderfully eleuate the heart, expelling drouſineſſe to cheere the whole man. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is beneficiall vnto others hearing it, if ſeaſonably and deuoutly deliuered. Fourthly, it ſerues to put men in minde where and what they are; pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:177910:163"/> perſons in Gods preſence; where the Miniſter is the mouth of God to them, their mouth vnto God; ſo their mind goe along, an audible voyce is not neceſſary till it come to their turne to ſay A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: a diſorder it is in ſome places, men will ſay all the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, together with the Miniſter, ſtriuing who ſhall bee low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt.</p>

               <p>A. It is both; a forme for imitation, a prayer for vſe; prouided.

Thirdly, to raigne with him in glory hereafter for euermore.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is vocation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Firſt, Generally, it may be deſcribed to be a ſufficient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.28.</note> directed from the loue of God to men in miſerie and pointing out for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the way to mercy;<note place="margin">Luke 14.17, 18.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Acts 16.14.</note> offering life in the means ſufficient to make fire-brands of hell,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.28.9.24.</note> heires of heauen. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, more ſpecially, it is an effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all perſwaſion &amp; calling in time and at ſeuerall times,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.15.</note> of Gods Elect in Chriſt, from ſinne to grace, from ſickneſſe to health,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:177910:175"/> from darkeneſſe to light,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.14.</note> and from the ſtate of death to life.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How doth the Lord call men?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Two waies: firſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and ſo diuers waies: Firſt, by reports, of mercy ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or iudgements inflicted vpon others, as <hi>Rahab</hi> was called.<note place="margin">Ioſua 2.10. 2 Cor. 33.12</note> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by afflictions inward or outward, reall or verball, as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſes</hi> with diuers other; called or prepared thereby for an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall calling. Thirdly, moſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily and vſually by his Word in the miniſtery of men; which being preacht and preſt with wiſedome, zeale, and power, is Gods Ordinance to effect a three-fold worke: Firſt,<note place="margin">Acts 16.14.</note> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his heart that is to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, by the Law,<note place="margin">Zach. 13.1. Iohn 5.3, 4. 1 Cor. 1.21.</note> ſo as to let him ſee himſelfe in his naturall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. Secondly, to offer him balme from Gilead, the merits and blood of Chriſt to cure, and
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:177910:176"/> cleanſe his blacke and wounded ſoule,<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.14 1 Cor. 3.5. Iohn 3.8.</note> by the promiſes in the Goſpell. Thirdly, to ſtirre vp his affection trembling at the ſight of himſelfe, in a longing deſire to haue this remedie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. Secondly inwardly, God ſpeakes to the heart. Firſt, by the reflecting voice of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, telling him what is beſt to be done. Secondly, by the worke of his owne ſpirit gently bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the will, enlightning the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, ordering the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, &amp;c. and neuer leaues moulding, till ſuch be called and brought obediently ſubiect to the Goſpell of his Sonne.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Doth not Satan labour much to hinder this calling?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Yes, much and many waies:<note place="margin">Gal. 3.1. Pro. 1 10, 11 Mat. 13.19, 20.</note> as: Firſt, by deluſion, ioyning with mans deceitfull heart to counterfeit graces, and ſo to perſwade men they are called when they are not. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by avocation, buſying
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:177910:176"/> men with contrary employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Thirdly,<note place="margin">Luk. 14.18.</note> by temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, telling men they are not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led when they are;<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.10.</note> we ſhould therefore giue the more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to make our calling and election ſure.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>How may a Chriſtian know when he is called, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be called or no?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. Firſt, euer when hee enioyes the meanes, or feeles any inward motions to good,<note place="margin">1 The. 5.19.</note> then let him perſwade himſelfe he is called. Secondly, if he be heartily ſeperate in affection and conuerſation from the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked world,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.5. Iohn 8.32.</note> and the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons therein, purpoſely cleauing vnto the Lord in holineſſe of life. Thirdly, if hee perceiue the loue of Chriſt iſſuing from that coniugall Vnion betweene him and his Church, ſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in his heart, by a longing deſire it. Fourthly, if he bee ſenſible of any ſpirituall liberty,<note place="margin">Gal 4.15.</note>

               <p>Q. <hi>But ſuppoſe one finde no markes of Election, no ſignes of an effectuall calling, nor progreſſe in grace after many calles?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 20.6. 1 Cor. 15.8. 2 Pet. 1.10.</note>A. Firſt, let ſuch an one feare, not deſpaire of the power and goodneſſe of God: there are diuers houres of calling in the day. Secondly, let him acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the hinderance in himſelfe, and ſearch for it. Thirdly, let him make his caſe knowne to ſome experienſt Chriſtians. Fourthly, let him double his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in the vſe of all holy means with conſtancy; the Lord will be entreated.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What thinke you of ſuch as being called often, neglect or
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:177910:177"/> refuſe to come?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Firſt,<note place="margin">Luk. 17.1, 2.</note> ſome fault may be in the meſſenger calling: as: Firſt, in his perſon, weakening, and diſcrediting his doctrine by his life. Secondly, in the manner of deliuery of his meſſage after a cold, heartleſſe faſhion, ſeldome working on the affections of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: then their caſe is lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Secondly, if the fault be in themſelues,<note place="margin">Pro. 1.24, 25 Heb. 3.13, 15 Iohn 15.22.</note> then it is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly deſperate: for: Firſt, God will not heare their prayers, when they call and cry in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt miſery. Secondly, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent call may be the laſt in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and the next may be in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and wrath to iudgement. Thirdly, all former calles will riſe vp as witneſſes againſt them.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Is this calling neceſſary?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Yes, without which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly no man comes vnto God:<note place="margin">Mat. 20.6.22.3.</note> when our Sauiour moued this queſtion: why ſtand yee

               <p>Q. <hi>If calling be ſo neceſſary, what thinke you of Miniſters who are ſent to call onely and are not called?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Firſt, if they be not effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually called,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.30. Pſa. 51.13.</note> they cannot bee ſaued. Secondly, they ſhould be called, before they be ſent to call others.<note place="margin">Math. 5.13. Luk. 22.32.</note> Thirdly, they may be called after, although the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures imply that to be both a rare and a difficult worke.

               <p>Q. <hi>How may a Chriſtian heare the call of God in his Word by his Ministers with profit?</hi>

               <pb n="317" facs="tcp:177910:178"/>

Thirdly,<note place="margin">Mat. 13.23. Iohn 15.14.</note> by tenderneſſe of conſcience, which before was hard and large enough.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 80.19.</note>Anſ.

               <p>Q. <hi>By what meanes are men thus conuerted?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Firſt, by the Word of God calling them: preaching is Gods ordinance to conuert,<note place="margin">Cant. 6.13.</note> and the grace of couerſion firſt appeares in the affection.<note place="margin">Acts 9.4.</note> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by the Spirit tempering the hardneſſe of their hearts, as fire doth Iron,<note place="margin">Iohn 6.63.

Thirdly, not without a concurring act of their owne will manifeſted. Firſt, in an aptitude to receiue the habit of grace, hauing diſpoſed faculties,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:177910:179"/> capable of ſuch an alteration. Secondly, in action, and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after the firſt infuſion of ſpirituall life, to ſee the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, will, and labour after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; preſuppoſing free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in part by diuine reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before any of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed faculties begin to ſtirre; being made good trees by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, they beare good fruit by aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>From what and to what are men conuerted?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Firſt, from the tyrannous dominion vnder ſinne, and the power of darkeneſſe vnto the liberty of true conuerts vnder grace;<note place="margin">Col. 1.13.

               <p>Q. <hi>Doe men conuerted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes know the time of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſions?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Firſt, ſome may know it by carefull obſeruation, or extraordinary reuelation; all doe not. Secondly, let none deny the worke of grace, through doubtfull diſtruſt,<note place="margin">Iohn 3.8.</note> becauſe hee knowes not the time when it was beſtowed.

               </p>
               <p>A. Firſt, by obſeruation of ſuch inward motions, as hee may remember once to haue

               </p>
               <p>A. A Chriſtians ſecond birth, wherein he hath the new man raiſed vp in him,<note place="margin">Iohn 3.3. 1 Pet. 1.23.</note> the Image of God repaired, ſpirituall life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed; and the ſeed of euery neceſſary grace reimplanted.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How, by whom, and when is regeneration wrought?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Firſt,<note place="margin">Iohn 3.5.</note> the principall agent is the Spirit of God, infuſing the habite of grace into all the powers of the ſoule,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.23.</note> ſo ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and diſpoſing it to all holy motions, and operations.<note place="margin">1 Iohn 3.9.</note> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the inſtruments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, are of three ſorts. Firſt, ſimply ſpirituall; ſuch is the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue quality of grace, giuing a power to doe good by the firſt act, and called preuenting grace; ſtirring vp the will to make vſe of that power by a ſecond act,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.8.</note> called working grace;<note place="margin">Acts 18.27.</note> enabling the whole to manifeſt that power and will indeed, by a third act, and then
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:177910:182"/> called coworking or aſſiſting grace.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.10. Tit. 2.11. 1 Cor. 4.15.</note> Secondly, morall; ſuch is the Sacrament of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thirdly, naturall, ſuch are Miniſters faithfully diſpenſing the Myſteries of God, in the promulgation of the Goſpell of Chriſt.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.23. Ioh. 10.10.</note> Thirdly, the roote and ſeed, whence this new life flowes, is Chriſt, and his Word; as head deriuing life to the members of his myſticall Body, by meanes of his humanity, the quickning power being in and from his Deity.<note place="margin">Eccle. 11.5.</note> Fourthly, the manner is hidden and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret;<note place="margin">Iohn 3.8.</note> Chriſts incarnation points out the manner of our regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The Holy Ghoſt ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaddowes the ſoule, and by his quickning power frames the new man inſenſibly of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall ſeed; thus much onely we may know. Firſt, there is a diſpoſition by way of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, all lets are remoued. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, a conception by a Vnion
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:177910:182"/> of grace with nature in the ſoule. Thirdly, a growth gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in diuers parts diuerſly, as in an infant. Fourthly, a birth in the manifeſtation of this life, by a regular motion in ſpirituall imployments. Fiftly, the time is at once inſtantly whenſoeuer it is; no certainety when, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed, nor ſet time appointed: ſome at one time, by one or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance; ſome at another time, by another.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Are not all men regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate onely in and by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Regeneration in Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. No: for firſt ſome haue had, and many haue the grace of Regeneration, before they could come to make vſe of that, or any other Sacrament, liuing and dying neuer ſenſible of any change in them. Secondly, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue, and may receiue the ſeede of Grace in, and with the Sacrament; ſowne then in
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:177910:183"/> their hearts,<note place="margin">Ier. 1.5.</note> may lye hid vnder the clods of naturall corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.21.</note> and ſpring vp long after, by the power of ſpirituall raine, and heat. Thirdly, a third ſort may haue it neither before, nor in Baptiſme, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it after by the vſe of ſome other ordinance; thus might <hi>Simon Magus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 9.22.</note> had he repented and truely beleeued after his baptiſme: the Lord is a free agent, may beſtow his grace when, and how he pleaſeth; willing men to yeeld honour, and reſpect to all his ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>How may a Chriſtian doubting, be comfortably perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of his Regeneration?</hi>

               <p>Anſ. Firſt, let him looke backe vpon, and receiue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from his Baptiſme, which did certainely bring ſome good to his ſoule. Secondly, let him take notice of the ordinary manner of the manifeſtation<note place="margin">Gal. 3.27.</note>

               <p>Q. <hi>What muſt wee examine our ſelues about in the third place?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. About thoſe ſins we haue committed in our life time:<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.5.</note> and that firſt in regard of our nature, in euery paſſage of our life,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.3.</note> more prone to one ſinne then another.

               <p>A. Vnto thoſe graces which are or ſhould be in him, before hee preſume to come to the Lords Table; eſpecially faith and repentance?</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. It is a rich and precious grace of God whereby the new man is enabled,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.1. Iam. 2.5.

               </p>
               <p>A. Firſt, by that feare hee hath had,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.28.</note> or doth feele in him of Gods wrath and Hell tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments due to him for his many ſinnes.<note place="margin">Luke 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="345" facs="tcp:177910:192"/> Thirdly, by a deſire after faith in the leaſt meaſure,<note place="margin">Mark. 9.24.</note> that hee might apply one promiſe and touch but the Hem of his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours garment. Fourthly,<note place="margin">Pſal 116.10. Mat. 4.31.</note> by an earneſt prayer for pardon and Gods fauour in Chriſt aboue all things in the world, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring ſtill how worthy he is of Iudgements,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.8.</note> how vnworthy of any mercy. Fifthly, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſiue doubtings of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and the truth of his grace. Sixthly, by a finall caſting of himſelfe into the Armes of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Iob 13.15.

               <p>Q. <hi>What is falſe and faigned faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. It is a carnall preſumption, and a groundleſſe perſwaſion,<note place="margin">Luke 13.3.</note> of men and women within the pale of a viſible Church,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.14.</note> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſaluation without ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, to haue pardon of ſinne, without parting from ſinne.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How may this be knowne?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Firſt, by the beginning thereof,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.17. Gal. 2.20.</note> iſſuing from the proud fleſh without any loue or vſe of Gods ordinances.

Fourthly, by boaſting of a full perſwaſion, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ground, trouble, or doubting;
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:177910:193"/> it makes men confident, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent. Fifthly, by barrenneſſe,<note place="margin">Iames 2.26.</note> it is a ſolitarie faith, fruitleſſe in euery regard; and as the bodie without the ſpirit is dead, ſo faith without workes is dead alſo.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is Repentance?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. It is a ſupernaturall grace,<note place="margin">Math. 9.13. Acts 26.10. 2 Cor. 7.9, 10.</note> whereby a ſorrowfull beleeuing ſinner, is brought backe from the loue, and practice of ſinne, vnto the loue and ſeruice of God, with a ſtedfaſt purpoſe neuer to returne againe.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How may a Chriſtian know he hath truely repented?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Firſt, by thoſe formerly mentioned fruits of faith, from which repentance is vnſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, being one of them.<note place="margin">Eſay 30.21.

Fourthly, by a ſpeedie, full, and orderly though im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Q. <hi>Can a man repent of a ſin and yet continue in it or any other knowne?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. No, it is not poſſible; the verie nature of repentance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in humiliation, and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:177910:194"/> of all wholly, or of none truely.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But may not a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an repent of a ſinne, fall into the ſame againe, yet repent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. It is a dangerous thing to relapſe into ſinnes once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of,<note place="margin">Mat 18.22.</note> yet vpon true and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious repentance againe, we doe beleeue there is pardon to bee obtained.
